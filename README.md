### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Enabling Internode Encryption in Apache Cassandra
---

Enabling internode encryption in Apache Cassandra involves configuring the communication between nodes in a Cassandra cluster to be encrypted. This is done to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data being transmitted between nodes in the cluster. The process of enabling internode encryption can involve updating configuration files, generating and distributing SSL/TLS certificates, and restarting services. This incident type may arise due to a security audit or a compliance requirement that mandates communication between nodes in a Cassandra cluster to be encrypted.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_CASSANDRA="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_JAVA="PLACEHOLDER"

export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD="PLACEHOLDER"

export VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Java is installed
```shell
java -version
```

### Check Cassandra version
```shell
${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA}/bin/nodetool version
```

### Check if internode encryption is enabled
```shell
${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA}/bin/nodetool getsslinfo
```

### Check if SSL encryption is enabled in Cassandra configuration
```shell
grep -i "server_encryption_options" ${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA}/conf/cassandra.yaml
```

### Check if the keystore file exists and has the correct permissions
```shell
ls -l ${PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE}
```

### Check if the keystore password is correct
```shell
${PATH_TO_JAVA}/bin/keytool -list -v -keystore ${PATH_TO_KEYSTORE_FILE} -storepass ${KEYSTORE_PASSWORD}
```


### Check the Cassandra logs for any errors related to internode encryption
```shell
tail -f ${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA}/logs/system.log | grep "internode encryption"
```

## Repair

### Verify that the cluster is running a version of Apache Cassandra that supports internode encryption, and if not, upgrade to a version that does.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the desired Cassandra version here

desired_version=${VERSION}



# Check if Cassandra is already installed and what version is running

installed_version=$(cassandra -v | grep 'Cassandra' | cut -d ' ' -f 3)

if [ -z "$installed_version" ]; then

  echo "Cassandra is not installed."

  exit 1

fi



echo "Cassandra version $installed_version is currently installed."



# Check if the installed version supports internode encryption

if [[ "$installed_version" != *"-beta"* ]] && [[ "$installed_version" < "4.0" ]]; then

  echo "Cassandra version $installed_version does not support internode encryption."

  echo "Upgrading to version $desired_version..."



  # Download the desired Cassandra version

  wget https://downloads.apache.org/cassandra/$desired_version/apache-cassandra-$desired_version-bin.tar.gz



  # Extract the downloaded Cassandra version

  tar -xzf apache-cassandra-$desired_version-bin.tar.gz



  # Stop the currently running Cassandra instance

  sudo service cassandra stop



  # Replace the Cassandra installation directory with the new version

  sudo mv apache-cassandra-$desired_version /usr/share/cassandra



  # Start the new Cassandra instance

  sudo service cassandra start



  # Verify that the new version is running

  installed_version=$(cassandra -v | grep 'Cassandra' | cut -d ' ' -f 3)

  if [[ "$installed_version" != *"$desired_version"* ]]; then

    echo "Failed to upgrade to Cassandra version $desired_version."

    exit 1

  fi



  echo "Successfully upgraded to Cassandra version $desired_version."

else

  echo "Cassandra version $installed_version already supports internode encryption."

fi



exit 0
